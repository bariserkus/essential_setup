### Command Line CMAKE

This is for build using the command line CMAKE. The build directory is assummed to be `build`.

First do cmake:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    
Then, make in the `build` directory:

    $ make
    
Execute the short version:

    $ ./testtbb_short
    
and the long version:

    $ ./testtbb_long
    
### CLion

You can start the CLion from Applications, instead of starting it off from the command line (as in the case of oneTBB).

Open this directory as a project and build it as usual. You can run both short and long versions from the `Configurations` bar.
