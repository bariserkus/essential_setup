# Testing for TBB

TBB is the older version of Threading Building Blocks. It is still available at Ubuntu repos for installation and can be installed using `apt`:

`$ sudo apt install libtbb-dev`

The GitHub page for TBB is still available (see [here][2]), but it does not seem to be frequently updated, and it directs you to newer oneTBB pages. Still the package seems to be working under Ubuntu 20.04. There is no need to set enviroment manually for old TBB.
